<h1> The Best Anime according to Midhula </h1>
<h2> The top 3 best anime's are</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>
    I like the way it provides life lesson to not give up on your dreams, no matter what background you came from <br />
    and no matter how weak you are , you can be the strongest , if you work hard.
</p>
<h3>One piece</h3>
<p>
    I love the friendship that is potrayed in this anime and the trust each member holds on eachother.<br />
    my favourite character is zoro and luffy . Luffy is really funny
</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>
    I like the animations, the fights and the use of katana to kills monsters. <br />
    I also like how this anime potrays the villain's side story , which lead them to choose the bad path.
